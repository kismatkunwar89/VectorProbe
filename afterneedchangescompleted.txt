README.md - Needs updates for:

✅ Already has: Installation, basic usage, dependencies
❌ MISSING: AD enumeration dependencies (ldap-utils, dnsutils, samba-common-bin)
❌ MISSING: Updated usage examples showing AD enumeration
❌ MISSING: More comprehensive feature list
limitations.md - Needs enhancement:

✅ Has generic limitations
❌ MISSING: AD enumeration specific limitations (from task 6.5.11):
Tool availability constraints
.local DNS domain interpretation
LDAP Base DSE visibility requirements
Unauthenticated scope boundaries
DC-only targeting explanation
Partial enumeration scenarios
LDAP data precedence rules
contributions.md - Needs update:

✅ Has Kismat and Gamvirta sections
❌ MISSING: Recent AD enumeration work attribution
❌ MISSING: Recent bug fixes and improvements
user_guide.md - Needs verification:

✅ Has basic usage
❌ Check if complete with all options and examples
2. Testing & Validation (Part 2: 20% of grade)
❌ Test against minimum 5 different hosts/networks

Must include both Windows and Linux systems
Current testing appears limited to fixtures
❌ Create sample output reports in samples/ directory

samples folder currently empty
Need real-world enumeration reports demonstrating:
Windows host with AD enumeration
Linux host enumeration
Mixed network scan
Fast-scan mode example
Normal mode example
